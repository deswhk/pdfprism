# pdfprism

A PDF reader and editor built on PyMuPDF and PySide6.

A prism decomposes light into its components; pdfprism decomposes PDFs into theirs — pages, text, images, metadata — and gives you the tools to read them, restructure them, secure them, and put them back together.

## Status

Under active development. Not yet ready for general use.

## Scope

**In scope for v1:**
- Reader: rendering, navigation, zoom, view modes, thumbnails, outline, text search, multi-document tabs, full-screen, dark mode, recent files

- Page operations: rotate, delete, insert, reorder, crop, extract, split, merge, duplicate
- Security: password protection, permissions, metadata sanitization, redaction
- OCR for scanned PDFs (Tesseract)
- Visual diff between two PDFs
- Optimization: compression, linearization
- Combine PDFs, images, and text files into one PDF

**Out of scope for v1:**
Annotations, forms, digital signatures, in-place text editing, PDF/A conversion, Office-document combine, HEIC image support.
